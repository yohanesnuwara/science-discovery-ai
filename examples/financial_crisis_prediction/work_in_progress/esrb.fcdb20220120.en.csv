Motivation: While misaligned incentives, low capitalisation, low profitability, as well as high credit growth and leverage were at the root of the crisis, the crisis only started when these shortcomings came to the fore through liquidity problems in the interbank market in September 2008, after the default of Lehman Brothers.","The crisis evolved similarly as in many other advanced economies. While the direct exposure towards the US subprime market was rather limited the effects hit the Austrian banking sector mainly after the dry-up of the interbank markets following the Lehman Brothers default in September 2008 which brought the long-term structural weaknesses of the banking system to the fore. With rising credit spreads in CESEE in early 2009, international investors feared an additional hit on the Austrian banking sector, but the situation stabilised during the course of that year, also due to the Vienna Initiative. NPLs grew during the downturn of the real economy in 2009. In response to the crisis, the authorities took several steps to support the banking system and to strengthen financial oversight.","In response to the crisis, the authorities took several steps to support the banking system and to strengthen financial oversight. They include: - Capital support and funding guarantees by the federal state of Austria. The Austrian Financial Market Stability Package of 2008 included: €15 billion for bank recapitalization measures; up to €75 billion of bank funding guarantees; and unlimited deposit insurance until end-2009. A federal entity was created to manage public participations in the banking system. The legal basis was laid out in the Interbank Market Support Act (""Interbankmarktstärkungsgesetz"") and the Financial Market Stability Act (""Finanzmarktstabilitätsgesetz""). - Measures targeting foreign currency loans. The FMA followed up its urgent recommendation to banks not to grant foreign currency loans to households with an extension of its Minimum Standards for Granting and Managing Foreign Currency Loans and Loans with Repaymnet Vehicles in March 2010. Moreover, Austria has implemented the set of seven recommendations published by the European Systemic Risk Board in the fall of 2011 with a view to curbing lending in foreign currency. Integrating the three previous versions, the new Minimum Standards issued by the FMA in 2013 also take account of both the ESRB’s recommendations and supervisory experience. In particular, they address the issue of foreign currency lending by subsidiaries of Austrian banks abroad (especially in CESEE). In addition, domestic banks’ business in the region is subject to Guiding Principles published by the OeNB and the FMA in 2010. The measures are considered as ""soft law"". - Strengthening of the sustainability of the business model of large Austrian banks (""Sustainability Package""). In March 2012, the OeNB and the FMA published a supervisory guidance on strengthening the sustainability of the business models of large internationally active Austrian banks with a view to contributing to financial stability both in Austria and in the subsidiaries’ host countries. More specifically, the set of measures aimed at (i) increasing these banks’ capital base in the medium and long term, (ii) achieving a more balanced refinancing structure of exposed subsidiaries, and (iii) ensuring that banks have in place adequate recovery and resolution plans for potential crisis situations. Between 2012 and 2015, the guidance applied to three Austrian banking groups on the grounds of their size, systemic relevance as well as the complexity of their business models (numerous subsidiaries): Erste Group Bank, Raiffeisen Zentralbank and UniCredit Bank Austria. From 2016 onwards, the guidance applies only to two Austrian banking groups (Erste Group Bank and Raiffeisen Bank International). The Sustainability Package is considered as ""soft law"". - Cross-border collaboration by FMA and OeNB. Austria has been an active participant in the Vienna Initiative aiming to bolster coordination among home and host country authorities and avoid disorderly deleveraging in CESEE. The Initiative was launched in January 2009. It brought together all the relevant public and private sector stakeholders of EU-based cross-border banks active in emerging Europe, which owned much of the banking sectors in that region and also held a significant part of government securities. - Expiration of Interbank Market Support Act by end-2010 - Deregulation of Austrian Bank Hypo Alpe Adria and the creation of the wind-down entity by end-2014.

CY,2.0,2011-06,2016-03,2016-06,1,"Excessive credit growth and leverage, exposure concentration, mismatches and market illiquidity, misaligned incentives. Motivation: During the last decade, economic growth in Cyprus was partly driven by a business model whereby significance was given to the financial sector, with the domestic banks holding a dominant position. The country, in its effort to become a leading international provider of banking services, managed to attract significant inflows of foreign deposits in the banking system, offering high interest rates on deposits, which were on average significantly higher than those prevailing in the rest of the euro area. This led to a dramatic expansion of banks’ balance sheets, both domestically and abroad. This development resulted in the accumulation of large imbalances and vulnerabilities in the banking sector. First, the rapid domestic credit expansion was facilitated by significant inflows of foreign deposits and imprudent lending practices by banks, due to inadequate risk management and corporate governance frameworks, which fuelled a boom in the real estate sector. When serious problems emerged in this sector of the economy, the quality of banks’ loan portfolio deteriorated dramatically. In addition, the acceleration in the growth rate of bank loans resulted in the continuous growth of debt for both households and non-financial corporations, thus making them vulnerable to potential shocks. At the same time, households and businesses operated in a high lending rate environment that contributed to the deterioration of their financial position and, by implication, their ability to meet their debt obligations. In parallel, there was a significant expansion by Cypriot banks abroad, especially in Greece, with a marked increase in exposure to the private sector, which continued during the period of prolonged recession. The deterioration of macroeconomic conditions in Greece led to a rapid increase in non-performing loans. Moreover, Cypriot banks suffered very heavy losses from the restructuring of Greek Government debt and the Private Sector Involvement (“PSI”). This had further serious negative effects on the robustness of their balance sheets. The solvency of the Cypriot banking sector began to deteriorate significantly in mid-2011. The increased provisions due to the deterioration in the quality of banks' loan portfolio amid the unfavourable macroeconomic environment in Cyprus and Greece and the losses incurred due to the ‘haircut’ of Greek Government Bonds (""GGBs"") led to record losses for banks in the last two years, and exerted strong pressure on their liquidity and capital base. More specifically, the three largest domestic banks suffered total losses of €4,4 billion or 24,2% of GDP due to the ‘haircut’ of GGBs. The increase in assets gradually overtook deposit inflows, with the loan-to-deposit ratio following an upward trend since March 2011. The successive downgrades in the credit rating of the Republic of Cyprus and Cypriot banks by international credit rating agencies led to their exclusion from international markets for refinancing. The liquidity buffers in the banking system were gradually eroded and, in the cases where they were exhausted, and there was no ability to raise liquidity through the refinancing operations of the Eurosystem, the Central Bank of Cyprus (""CBC"") provided Emergency Liquidity Assistance to satisfy the banks’ liquidity needs. The contraction of the liquidity buffers was due to the decrease in liquid assets following the downgrades of Greek and Cyprus sovereign bonds, the reduction in customer deposits and the decline in cash inflows from loan repayments, after the increase in the proportion of customers who did not meet the specified repayment schedule of their debt obligations. At the same time, significant external and internal imbalances were created beyond the banking sector, particularly regarding to accumulating current account deficits, substantial losses in competitiveness, growing budget deficits and inflating public debt. These, together with the significant contingent liability that would have arisen if the country needed to support such a large domestic banking sector, led to the continuous downgrading of the Republic and, consequently, to the inaccessibility of the government to international markets for refinancing. These developments also limited the ability of the country to address the problems of the banking sector when they occurred. In light of the above conditions, including Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB)’ s request for state-aid support for recapitalisation in May 2012, the Cypriot authorities officially submitted a request for financial aid, in the form of a loan, to the European Financial Stability Facility (“EFSF”) / European Stability Mechanism (“ESM”) and the International Monetary Fund on 25 June 2012, aiming at the recovery of the economy on a path of sustainable growth, the restoration of the proper functioning of the banking sector and to ensure conditions of financial stability. Following extensive negotiation, an agreement on the key elements of the Cyprus macroeconomic adjustment programme was reached on 25 March 2013. One of the key objectives was to restore the soundness of the Cypriot credit institutions sector and rebuild depositors’ and market confidence by thoroughly restructuring and downsizing financial institutions and strengthening supervision, according to the terms of the Eurogroup agreement of 25 March 2013. The immediate downsizing of the credit institution sector was considered necessary given its large size and the accumulated imbalances. This was achieved with the carve-out of the Greek operations of the three largest Cypriot banks, namely Bank of Cyprus (BoC), Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB) and Hellenic Bank (HB), in accordance with the provisions of The Resolution of Credit and Other Institutions Law of 2013. Moreover, CPB was resolved according to a “good bank – bad bank” strategy. Insured deposits, interbank liabilities and Emergency Liquidity Assistance exposures were absorbed at nominal value by BoC, together with Cypriot and UK assets that were transferred at fair value. The remaining assets of the bank, including foreign subsidiaries and branches, will be liquidated over time to compensate uninsured depositors, other creditors and shareholders of the bank that remained in the legacy part of CPB. BoC, on the other hand, was recapitalised by the bail-in of shareholders, bondholders and the overall conversion of 47,5% of uninsured deposits, following an independent fair value assessment of BOC and CPB’s assets and liabilities.","The crisis came to a head following a build-up of large vulnerabilities in recent years. In part, these were related to significant bank exposure to Greece, which resulted in sizeable losses following the Greek debt restructuring (an amount in excess of €4 billion of losses was suffered by the Cypriot banks as a result of the Greek Government Bond restructuring). But the unwinding of a domestic housing boom and the economic downturn in Cyprus also contributed to the deterioration of the banks’ loan portfolio. As a result, the two largest banks were confronted with solvency problems.","The successive downgrades in the credit rating of the Republic of Cyprus and Cypriot banks by international credit rating agencies led to their exclusion from international markets for refinancing.

Motivation: 1) As of end 1973 the Herstatt bank had a balance sheet of DM 2 billions, capital of DM 77 millions, gross positions in foreign exchange of more than DM 30 billions, with open positions at around DM 2 billions. When the bank failed, contagion was magnified by counterparty risks from these positions, intransparency on banks' exposures and a run on deposits (interconnectedness). 2) Another potential vulnerability - that was building up in the years before 1974 - was increasing leverage in real estate construction. Also the inflationary environment made it difficult for banks to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers and facilitated a misallocation of capital. Although we did not find evidence that this vulnerability materialized in a systemic banking crisis or a credit crunch, it is possible that the benefit of implementing counter-cyclical and/or real estate related macro-prudential instruments before 1973 would have outbalanced the cost. Indeed, in March 1973 the liquidity regulation for banks was tightened somewhat (counter-cyclically), revoking an easing of those standards in 1969.","In the early 1970s the regime of floating exchange rates implied new trading opportunities for banks, while risk management practices were inappropriate. On 26 June 1974 the closure of the insolvent Herstatt bank disrupted the settlement of a large number of foreign exchange payments. At the international level the bank’s failure hit confidence in the so-called Euro-currency market which was seen as particularly vulnerable after a period of rapid expansion. At the domestic level contagion became evident when a number of smaller and mid-sized private banks suffered deposits outflows. These events evolved against the backdrop of a fragile economic environment, following an oil-price shock, high inflation, weak industrial investment and slowing residential construction.","To calm the situation after the Herstatt closure, the Bundesbank restored the banks' rediscount quotas in full and offered unlimited Lombard credit at the standard rate. Additional refinancing facilities were made available to private and regional banks, as well as to the Reconstruction Loan Corporation (KFW) in respect of its lending to small firms. Moreover, the Bundesbank participated in the establishment of a liquidity consortium bank to give support to basically sound banks in temporary difficulties.

Motivation: 1) Exposure concentration: although financial institutions did not violate standard large exposure regulations, substantial write-downs accumulated from credit default correlations and stock market valuations. 2) Excessive credit growth and leverage: this relates to both the balance sheets of non-financial borrowers and banks (in particular, for the latter leverage increased the risk of pro-cyclical behaviour in the downturn, e.g. reduction of RWAs). 3) Misaligened incentives: conflicts of interests between stock market analysts / financial advisors / brokers / investment banking as well as concerns about market manipulation resulted in legal reforms (parts of Viertes Finanzmarktförderungsgesetz, Gesetz zur Verbesserung des Anlegerschutzes); structural vulnerabilities in the German banking sector (high cost and low market share of the individual institutions) were not decidedly addressed before the crisis.","The cyclical downturn, following a domestic credit boom and the implosion of the “new economy"" stock market bubble, put significant stress on a structurally vulnerable German financial sector. The number of insolvencies in the non-financial corporate sector surged. From the three potential shock absorbers in the banking sector two were strongly eroded: profitability was low across all banking groups and hidden reserves were depleted to a large extent by falling asset prices as well as credit write-downs. Against this backdrop many banks, including some of the largest institutions, had to adjust their balance sheets and to correct lending standards in a pro-cyclical way. In late 2002 and early 2003 there was an elevated risk of a downward spiral due to negative feedback mechanisms in the financial system.","Most banks in distress could be stabilized or merged within the respective banking groups (savings banks, credit cooperatives and commercial banks). Among the larger institutions Bankgesellschaft Berlin was identified by the banking supervisory authority as a potential restructuring case, due to losses related to real estate exposure.

DE,3.0,2007-08,2013-06,2013-06,1,"Mismatches and market illiquidity, exposure concentration, excessive credit growth and leverage. Motivation: The interaction between the different vulnerabilities was important. In the early stages of the crisis exposure concentrations and market liquidity risks were underestimated as banks were affected by the collapse of shadow banking activities (examples in Germany: IKB and SachsenLB). Other aspects of exposure concentrations were the distress of SIFIs, in particular after the Lehmen Brothers default. SIFIs could not be wound-down orderly without substantial government intervention (example HRE). In addition to securitizations, some German banks had also high exposure concentrations to CRE and the shipping industry. Regarding excessive leverage: capital requirements for securitizations and other specific risks were too low. Generally high leverage increased the risk of pro-cyclical fire sales and a credit supply crunch. In the later stage of the crisis exposure concentration to stressed EMU sovereigns and banking systems would have affected banks in Germany in the absence of comprehensive stabilisation policies.","In the years before the crisis financial institutions domiciled in Germany had become strongly interconnected with the international financial system. Hence they were involved in the build-up of systemic risks in this system, while domestic credit demand expanded only moderately. The drying up of market and funding liquidity was a key element during the early stages of the crisis when shadow banking activities collapsed amid uncertainty of how complex securitizations should be valued. Another key element was the vulnerability of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), in particular, after the United States decided to let Lehman Brothers go into insolvency. In addition to securitizations, some banks in Germany had noticeable exposures to commercial real estate and the shipping industry. High leverage increased the risk of pro-cyclical fire sales and a credit crunch. In the later stage of the crisis exposures to stressed EMU sovereigns and banking systems could have severely affected the financial sector in Germany in the absence of comprehensive stabilisation policies.","Initially the crisis was treated as a liquidity crunch with problems only at individual institutions. On 9 August, 2007, the ECB provided an unlimited ‘fine-tuning’ operation.

As the starting point was a highly indebted economy, large current-account deficits and a structurally weak labour market, there was a need for strong fiscal improvements and incentives for private savings. Finally, as a result of overheating of the economy in the mid-1980s, high wage increases were agreed in connection with the collective bargaining in 1987. This led to deterioration of competitiveness in the exporting sectors of a magnitude that prompted the government to intervene at the end of the year. After the unfolding of the currency crisis in the European Monetary System since 1992-93,in January 1993 Danish and international opinion-makers started to speculate on whether Denmark would devalue the krone to achieve a quick improvement of employment or let the krone float with a view to both a lower value of the krone and lower interest rates. The Danish krone became an object of speculation. Danmarks Nationalbank defended the krone through interventions and the interest rates were raised. Several banks got in to difficulties during the period, however the most serious crises in Denmark were limited to small and medium-sized banks.

In Denmark the fall in the real gross domestic product, GDP, was approximately 5 per cent in 2009, the most rapid recession seen since the end of World War II. About two thirds of the unexpected large fall in real GDP in 2009 can be attributed to lower growth in the export markets. The Danish economy was in a slowdown phase even before the global financial crisis really took off in 2008, however.  The period up to the crisis was marked by several years of high real growth in the banks' outstanding amounts of loans. Historically, periods of high lending growth have often been followed by higher write-downs on loans and losses, indicating that credit quality tends to deteriorate during periods of high lending growth. The banks accumulated large customer funding gaps during a period of strong lending growth. They financed the gaps, inter alia, by issuing short-term bonds and borrowing from foreign credit institutions. Short-term funding via the international money and capital markets is normally less stable and more sensitive to changes in the banks' own credit rating than deposits and long-term bond financing. The crisis in 2008-09 was of a global nature, thus substantially compromising the functionality of the international money and capital markets, and this shift in the funding structure gave cause for concern and contributed considerably to the extensive government measures to support the banking sector.","The government provided a safety net for the banks by way of a comprehensive government guarantee for depositors etc. In addition, the government provided capital injections to a large number of credit institutions and gave credit institutions the opportunity to purchase an individual government guarantee on debt issues.

Because of the high share of non-performing assets, banks were faced with liquidity problems.

The moratoriums were followed by a series of actions taken by the central bank and government to resolve the situation and stabilise the banking system.

Motivation: The Spanish economy was initially hit by the global financial crisis and the burst of a domestic housing bubble, which had been fed by excessive credit growth over the previous years. The resulting recessionary period alongside an over-exposure of savings banks to the real estate sector gave rise to the banking crisis. In a second stage the dynamics already in motion were amplified by contagion effects from other EA crisis and the weaknesses revealed in the EA architecture.","In Spain, the crisis had several phases which can be structured as follows. First, there was an economic crisis due to the collapse of the real estate market. Second, this economic crisis generated a deep banking crisis. Third, the combination of these two crises and distress in other euro area countries caused severe sovereign tensions starting in 2011. Interestingly and differently from countries, the fiscal position of Spain was relatively sound at the beginning of the crisis (eg: debt over GDP was below 40% at the beginning of the crisis). The depth of the economic recession and the banking crisis exhausted the absorbing capacity of government debt, resulting in sovereign tensions and capital flight. The main trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the housing bubble. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the end of the housing boom was precipitated by the effect of the international crisis on the financial market.","The lack of sufficient capital and loss-absorption capacity in a part of the banking sector were corrected by recapitalisation measures that combined capital increases at some banks, burden sharing mechanisms and the contribution of public funds in eight banking groups. The excessive exposure to highly procyclical assets (e.g. real estate) were corrected by increasing the volume of provisioning and by transferring the real estate exposures of the most vulnerable institutions to an external asset management company (SAREB). The corporate regime governing the savings banks was reformed with the new legislation on savings banks and bank foundations. Finally, re-sizing of the banking industry has come on the back of the intense process of rationalising the balance sheets of the banks that received public support.

Exports declined by just over 6 % and domestic demand by about 8 %. The unemployment rate doubled in the course of the year and exceeded 10 % at the end of the year. Corporate profitability was severely squeezed by the slump of domestic economic activity. Moreover, the collapse of Soviet Union, Finland’s export to the Soviet Union reached only about one-third of their level in the previous year. The number of corporate sector bankruptcies started to increase. The rapidly deteriorating economy caused a severely worsening in the banks’ financial position. Loss of confidence towards Skop Bank grew so large that the Bank of Finland was obliged to step in and take over control of the bank in September 19, 1991 in order to maintain the stability of financial system. Later in November, the Bank of Finland decided to allow the markka’s exchange rate to float temporarily. The next day, the Government decided to raise the limits of markka’s fluctuation range against the ECU by 14 per cent, implying a 12.1 per cent devaluation in the external value of the markka. In 1992, one of hardest systemic banking crisis in developed countries hit Finland. Operating profit of all banks and banking groups were hugely negative. Credit losses in 1992 were over 4 % of loans and, at the peak, NPLs accounted for over 15 % of the loan stock. During the crisis Finnish banks started major restructuring of the Finnish banking sector. The crisis period was over in 1995, when the aggregate banking sector made operating profit first time after the crisis years. One factor that worsened the crisis was, that in 1991, when the crisis started, no proper legislation was in place to manage the situation (ie. winding down procedures, or possibility to found publicly owned asset management companies. Finnish banking crisis was systematic and severe, but one peculiarity was that no bank failures existed, because, as in the case of Skop Bank, it was took over by the Bank of Finland. In local banking groups, both savings banks and co-operative banks, lot of mergers happened in order to handle the crisis. Two biggest commercial banks, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Union Bank of Finland merged in 1995. Major restructuring took place through restructuring the whole banking sector. Banks reduced substantially the number of staff and branches. For example at the end of 1995 the total number of employees in the Finnish banking sector was over one-third lower than its peak level in 1989. Another important structural changes in the banking sector were related to the cleanup of the banking crisis. Some banks had their banking licences cancelled and were converted into asset management companies.","Many different policies/interventions.

The deterioration of the international environment in 1990 (sharp increase in oil prices following the turmoil in the Persian Gulf) first triggered a severe macroeconomic slowdown from 1990 Q2 and a significant decrease in real estate prices. The French banks have been negatively impacted (increase in non-performing loans, fall in value of real estate property assets in portfolios ); they substantially reduced the supply of loans to investors (e.g. developers and sellers). As far as commercial properties were used as collateral, the sharp decrease in commercial real estate prices had a negative impact on the financial position of borrowers and, at the extreme, caused their default (i.e. difficulties in selling the goods at the initial anticipated price, incapacity to finalize the projects). Despite a bounce back effect in early 1991, the activity was then dampened by cumulative negative factors in 1991-1993: the ERM crisis in September 1992 affecting European partners and France to a lesser extent; the recession in domestic construction; the fragility of the banking sector and the near bankruptcy of the Crédit Lyonnais (losses related to the real estate market downturn and a risky business model strategy). The trough of the recession was reached in 1993 Q1.

Motivation: In the 1990s Croatia was confronted with the challenges of transition from the centrally planned to the market-based economy. In this period the business environment was characterized by heavy state involvement in the real sector, weak corporate governance, necessary yet harmful privatization process and the generally weak institutional framework. The banking system suffered in such environment in a number of aspects. First of all, the banking system supervision was at the time only being gradually established and therefore it was unable to enforce prudent governance in banks. Moreover, the regulations covering the establishment of banks were not demanding which encouraged a number of private agents with insufficient capacities to engage in banking activities. The result was a growing number of banks established by the private companies with the main goal to provide cheap financing to founding companies (exposure concentration, misaligned incentives). Furthermore, these banks were trying to increase their market share by credit expansion supported by very aggressive interest rate policies (excessive credit growth). The systemic risks which were accumulating in the banking system during the transition period materialized in 1998 and 1999 when a number of banks failed due to extensive credit losses.","In the 1990s Croatia was confronted with the challenges of transition from the centrally planned to the market-based economy. The systemic risks which were accumulating in the banking system during the transition period materialized in 1998 and 1999. The crisis started with the financial difficulties in the fifth largest bank and then spread across the banking system affecting other inadequately governed institutions. The real sector was not heavily affected by the banking crisis, since the crisis did not cause major problems for the largest banks in the system. In that regard it should be noted that government completed the resolution process (including write-offs of NPLs, recapitalization) over three large banks already in 1996, and those banks were sold to foreign financial institutions in late 1999 and early 2000.","In early 1998 government initiated resolution proceedings over a bank that was the fifth largest bank in the system at the time. Following difficulties in that bank, major losses were discovered in several other medium-sized and small banks, which resulted in the sharp drop in confidence and the surge in deposit outflows. In order to contain the panic, government made legislative adjustments so as to increase the amount of savings covered by the deposit insurance scheme. Moreover, government decided to open the bankruptcy proceedings for one bank in 1998 and for 7 more banks in 1999. Another important decision taken in 1998 was to start the preparation for the privatization of three large banks, which were previously recapitalized from public resources as part of the resolution proceedings in 1996. The privatization of those three institutions was completed in early 2000. As regards the measures implemented by monetary authorities, the central bank upgraded its refinancing facilities in 1998 by broadening the list of eligible collateral and reducing the interest rate on regular lending facility, as well as by significantly increasing its lending through the emergency liquidity facility.",0,0,1998-04 In April 1998 authorities initiated the resolution proceedings over the fifth largest bank in the system.,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,n.a.
HR,2.0,2007-09,2012-06,2016-09,1,"Excessive credit growth, misaligned incentives. Motivation: Excessive credit growth, financed primarily by parent institutions of domestic banks, was closely related to a build-up of external and internal imbalances. Namely, buoyant domestic demand supported by credit expansion led to a significant widening of the current account deficit, rapid accumulation of foreign debt, overheating of the real estate market and a deterioration of the competitiveness indicators. At the same time, strong capital inflows into shallow financial markets with limited supply exerted pressure on the domestic currency exchange rate and the prices of financial assets. The process of strong credit activity has also been accompanied by a decrease in the quality of granted loans and intensified risk-taking by the banks. The CNB was very active in addressing the vulnerabilities arising from banks’ behaviour. It applied several innovative instruments to tackle the intensive foreign borrowing of banks, which indirectly led to establishment of considerable capital and liquidity reserves in the system. In that regard, the most important instrument was the marginal reserve requirement (MRR) which was in force from mid-2004 until late 2008. The MRR required banks to deposit a significant share (up to 55%) of every additional net foreign borrowing to an FX account held at the central bank in order to tackle the problem of rapid accumulation of banks' foreign debt. In order to prevent the regulatory arbitrage, the central bank supplemented the MRR with another instrument, the special reserve requirement (SRR), which imposed similar obligations for banks in case they were issuing securities with an aim to obtain funding indirectly from their parent companies. By imposing such macro-prudential measures, the central bank managed to slow down the banks' foreign borrowing, while stimulating parent companies to inject capital instead. Furthermore, as a means to contain the excessive credit growth, the CNB imposed a limit on growth in bank placements at 12% annually. The banks that recorded an increase in placements in excess of 12% were obliged to purchase low yielding CNB bills worth 50% of the amount of excessive placements. As a direct result of an active macro-prudential policymaking, the Croatian banking system was very well capitalized at the beginning of the global financial crisis, while the central bank had built considerable buffers, which allowed it to pursue countercyclical policy at the peak of the global financial crisis. That in turn helped the banking system to survive the global turmoil and the prolonged recession with no major failures, which would have imposed large recapitalization costs on public finances. However, the CNB could not prevent other domestic sectors from engaging in foreign borrowing, so the net international investment position continued to deteriorate despite the ambitious efforts of the central bank. Persistent expansion of the domestic demand financed by foreign savings in the pre-crisis period caused major long-term damage to the Croatian economy. Namely, strong domestic demand supported the relative expansion of the non-tradable sectors with low productivity gains, such as construction and retail trade, while the capacities in the tradable sectors stagnated. The global financial crisis, which resulted in a sudden slowdown in capital inflows, caused an abrupt contraction of the domestic demand, while the external demand has been insufficient to provide a necessary boost to recovery due to various reasons (narrow export base, weak demand in the main trading partners). In such an environment, the Croatian economy has been confronted with a major structural growth crisis. Exposure concentration (portfolio structure). Motivation: The failure of a few small private banks should be primarily considered as a result of their inability to survive in a long lasting recessionary environment. Another unfavourable feature of those banks was their relatively heavier exposure to the SME sector which was hit by the recession the most, and at the same time insufficient capacities to participate in low-risk, relatively high-yield syndicated loans to domestic sovereign, as well as to loans to domestic blue-chip companies.","The crisis episode has been initiated by developments abroad which have exposed Croatian internal and external vulnerabilities. The Lehman Brothers collapse resulted in a previously unrecorded rise in global risk aversion and an increase in price volatility with a simultaneous plunge in liquidity and a rise in distrust among market participants. A sudden jump in the Croatian risk premium and a frozen international money market hindered the access of domestic sectors to foreign capital, which was reflected in all segments of the domestic financial market. Despite the previously unrecorded strength of that shock, financial system and exchange rate remained stable and the government has been enabled to repay the maturing debts due to the countercyclical monetary and macroprudential policy of the central bank. The crisis in the government debt market in peripheral euro area countries deepened in mid-2011. The renewed decline in investor risk appetite increased risk premiums, and stress spilled over onto the domestic financial system through foreign financial markets when the risk premium for Croatia rose, absolutely and relatively, much more than the premiums for European emerging markets, and exceeded the record level reached in early 2009. Apart from that, the increased reliance of subsidiaries on their parent banks increased their exposure to parent banks' liquidity, their needs for capital, financing strategies and to developments in their home countries, as well as in those in which they had considerable exposures. The worsening of the international debt market conditions in the second half of 2011 led to a rise in the CDS premiums of the parent banks of the five largest domestic banks. Their average level at the end of 2011 ranged about 500 basis points, primarily because of the exposures to peripheral euro area countries and concerns regarding the sustainability of their fiscal positions. Adverse developments in CDS premiums for Italy additionally increased the risk perception of Italian parent banks compared to those from Austria or France. This resulted in the partial withdrawal of the parent banks' funding from domestic banks and increased pressures on the foreign currency liquidity. The increased level of stress until the end of 2012 came from the international securities and money market due to high volatility and strong growth of uncertainty and risk aversion.","Although the first signs of troubles in global financial markets emerged in mid-2007, the global economic and financial crisis spilled over onto the domestic market late in 2008 with the threat of bringing capital inflows to a complete halt. At that time the CNB began to gradually release the previously established banking system's liquidity reserves in order to facilitate the financing of domestic sectors. The first moves were made in October 2008 after the Lehman Brothers collapse and appearance of the first signs of panic among domestic depositors when CNB abolished the marginal reserve requirement (MRR) to support foreign currency liquidity of the financial system. The MRR was introduced in 2004 to slow down the accumulation of banks' external debt by requiring them to allocate a significant share (up to 55 percent) of their net foreign borrowing into a special account held with the central bank, in the form of an interest-free foreign currency deposit. Further on, in order to additionally improve domestic financing conditions for the corporate sector, but also for the government which had substantial financing needs, CNB has also reduced the general reserve requirement rate from 17 to 14% in December 2008. Pressures on the weakening of the domestic currency that occurred at the end of 2008 due to limited net inflow of foreign capital have been smoothed by cutting the minimum required foreign currency claims rate from 28.5% to 25.0%, and additionally to 20.0% in February 2009, releasing even more foreign exchange liquidity. As credit activity slowed down significantly, credit growth restrains (which capped each bank's private credit growth at 12 percent per year) have been removed by the end of 2009. By these adjustments substantial foreign currency liquidity was released into the banking system, which helped to maintain exchange rate stability and country's external liquidity, and thus overall financial stability of the economy. In this context it should be noted that Croatian banking sector remained stable and very well capitalized during the crisis and no fiscal interventions were needed for banks' resolution. Although policy loosening has created a structural liquidity surplus, lending has continuously decelerated. With the aim of supporting the efforts to spur bank lending and economic recovery in early February 2010 the RR rate was lowered from 14% to 13% resulting with additional liquidity for banks within the framework of the stimulus programs that the government undertook in cooperation with the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As this attempt has not sufficiently boosted credit activity, in March 2011 the CNB lowered the minimum required foreign currency claims rate to 17% in order to further improve banks' credit potential, reduce their regulatory costs and lending rates and, in that way, to improve financing conditions for the corporate and household sectors. The turmoil in the European debt markets in the second half of 2011 affected the Croatian economy directly through the increase in the cost of foreign borrowing, but also indirectly through the withdrawal of parent banks’ funding from the Croatian banking system. Namely, the sovereign debt crisis caused a surge in CDS premium for parent banks, especially Italian financial groups which are highly exposed to (at the time, high-yield) Italian sovereign debt. Unfavourable market conditions prompted them to obtain funding by withdrawing resources from foreign subsidiaries, including Croatian banks, which led to depreciation pressures on the kuna exchange rate. The central bank engaged in four foreign exchange interventions in late 2011 and early 2012 in order to maintain the relatively stable exchange rate, which is the key instrument for preserving financial stability in Croatia. Furthermore, the central bank raised the reserve requirement from 13% to 15% to absorb the excess domestic currency liquidity and support the exchange rate. In late 2011 the central bank executed its role as a lender of the last resort when a couple of banks were confronted with deposit outflows and money market pressures following the failure of one small bank. Additionally, the CNB continued to address banking system's vulnerabilities caused by the prolonged recession. To be precise, as part of the supervisory review process, the CNB encouraged banks on a case by case basis to increase provisioning in order to address risks stemming from the high level of non-performing loans. In October 2013 the CNB switched to a rules-based approach when it adopted the revised Decision on the classification of placements and off-balance sheet liabilities, which requires banks to valuate assets more objectively and to recognize credit losses in a timely manner. The basic motivation of this regulatory intervention was to tackle the problem of banks engaging in debt restructurings (evergreening of loans) due to their unwillingness to activate the collateral in the environment of low liquidity of the real estate market. Although this measure led to a strong increase in provisioning costs which negatively reflected on banks’ earnings, the measure should be considered successful since it has resulted in the rising NPL coverage, while it has also indirectly encouraged banks to speed up the process of NPL resolution.",0,2,None.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,n.a.

Motivation: In Hungary a huge FX loan stock has piled up and due to the high household (predominantly in CHF) and governmental indebtedness the country was highly vulnerable. The excessive credit growth in the household sector resulted in high reliance on short-term debt and derivative instruments. When the financial crisis has reached Hungary, HUF sharply depreciated against CHF and the material credit and refinancing risks have materialized.","The Hungarian banking sector had not been affected directly by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. However, as the crisis in Europe escalated due to the interconnectedness of financial intermediaries and high external vulnerability of the domestic financial system, Hungary imported the crisis that affected it extremely seriously. The Lehman shock resulted in a previously unexperienced rise in global risk aversion, with a simultaneous plunge in liquidity and a sudden rise in distrust among market participants. The frozen international money market impeded access to foreign funding, which affected all segments of the Hungarian economy. Prior to 2008, both the public and the banking sector’s financing relied heavily on foreign funding and therefore had run foreign exchange risk and the risk of renewal of swaps, and with the escalation of the crisis these liability side risks materialised. Furthermore, the public sector’s budget deficit, increasing year by year, kept local currency (Hungarian forint) interest rates at high levels. On the assets side of the banking sector, the issuance of foreign currency-denominated loans was booming, due to lower funding costs. Besides the drying up of international money markets, the following two factors were important behind the build-up of increased vulnerability of the Hungarian banking sector and leading to a severe crisis: (i) most of the loans granted to households had been denominated in foreign currency (mainly Swiss francs); (ii) overheated disbursement of commercial real estate financing project loans to the corporate sector. Due to these two factors, the banking sector suffered from a rapidly increasing rate of non-performing loans and eroding profitability following the downturn.","In 2008, Hungary applied for an IMF credit line to mitigate the financing and liquidity tensions and to enhance investors' confidence in the country; governmental loans were provided for commercial banks.

IE,1.0,2008-09,2013-12,2014-09,1,"Excessive credit growth and leverage. Motivation: In the Irish crisis, the main Irish banks all increased their exposure to the real estate market to generate returns and expanded their loan portfolios using cheap sources of short-term wholesale funding. Concentration risk caused by exposure to a single asset class such as property increased. In tandem, the domestic private sector became increasingly leveraged pre-crisis and indebtedness rose. Therefore it is hard to disentage the vulnerabilities during this episode as excessive credit growth, excessive maturity mismatch, concentration risk and the dangers of misaligned incentives were all apparent to varying degrees during the Irish crisis.","Although the significant impairment of global debt markets in late-2008 created significant liquidity problems for the Irish banks, domestic macroeconomic imbalances and skewed banking sector strategies that emerged prior to this date were unsustainable and likely would have corrected even in the absence of the global shock.  Global developments likely amplified the impact of the adjustment. In terms of macroeconomic imbalances, a pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance and policies aimed at stimulating the construction sector coinciding with favourable domestic demand factors led to a construction/property boom in the decade prior to the crisis. The banking sector largely funded this boom by relying on cheap sources of external wholesale borrowing, rendering banks vulnerable to a change in market sentiment. Even if there had not been a liquidity crunch, however, it is likely that loan losses on a portfolio concentrated in property would have been inevitable as the property market peaked in late-2007 and the domestic market economic imbalances could not continue. It may have been possible that the scale of the banking crisis and the associated required intervention may not have been as significant if international funding markets remain open throughout the crisis.

IT,2.0,2011-08,2013-12,2017-06,1,Accelerator: tensions in sovereign bonds markets in the euro area.,"Instability originated in middle 2011 due to tensions in sovereign bonds markets in the euro area that affected the Italian real economy through three main transmission channels. 1) Banking channel: due to the pervasive role of government debt in the financial systems, banks and sovereigns are tightly intertwined. A deterioration in sovereign creditworthiness made bank funding more costly and difficult to obtain. Such funding difficulties translated in a higher cost of credit and give rise to an outright reduction in the availability of loans through the traditional bank lending channel. In Italy, banks’ cost of funding substantially increased in 2011 and so did the cost of new loans to non-financial corporations and households. 2) Confidence channel: the transmission of higher sovereign risk to the real economy may be accelerated and/or amplified through the deterioration in businesses’ and consumers’ confidence. During the euro-area sovereign debt crisis, confidence worsened in Italy, possibly reflecting many factors: the announcement and implementation of fiscal consolidation policies (i.e. government spending cuts and/or tax increases) to restore the sustainability of public finances; the negative developments in equity and bond markets which made the internal and external financing of investment more costly and affected consumption via negative wealth effects and the deterioration of the economic outlook. 3) Trade and financial linkages channel: the effects of tensions in sovereign debt markets quickly propagated across countries through international trade and financial linkages. During the sovereign debt crisis Italian intra-EMU exports declined substantially, mainly reflecting falling imports in the countries most affected by the sovereign tensions. In early 2012 banks’ funding difficulties in Italy were to a large extent alleviated by the ECB’s decisions to reduce the official rates in November and December 2011 and to launch the two 3-year longer-term refinancing operations. Uncertainty in financial markets temporarily retreated leading to an improvement in markets’ confidence. The sovereign spreads declined and the financing conditions became slightly more favorable. This notwithstanding, in 2012 the economic outlook remained negative. In 2013 financial conditions improved greatly. Yields on Italy’s ten-year BTPs fell to 3.0 per cent, less than half the peak figure recorded in November 2011, thanks to the crucial contribution of monetary policy. Since June 2012 there were large inflows of capital from the emerging economies. Structural reforms made the economy more resilient to future shocks, even if it will take time for them to yield their full fruits.

In addition, the internal environment was still weak, the riskiness of bank borrowers was difficult to assess and bank loan portfolios were poorly diversified.

The rapid growth of the public debt in the 1970s (from approx. USD 1 bn in 1970 to 26 bn in 1981) in order to boost the economy brought positive economic impact only in the short-run. Import of foreign goods, licenses and technology was aimed at increasing the export capabilities, which in turn would be the source of foreign currency to pay off debts. However, due to the inefficiencies in the centrally planned economy, goods produced for export proved to be uncompetitive in the global market. Consequently, Poland ran a trade deficit. Poland faced the danger of insolvency for the first time at the end of 1975. The default was averted through assistance from the USSR. Since then Poland had started to take out new loans chiefly to service the former ones. This accelerated the growth of the indebtedness (USD 13 bn in 1977; 26 bn in 1981). US trade sanctions - introduced as a response to martial law in Poland in 1981-1983 and in force until 1987 - further affected the economy. All of this resulted in the loss of creditworthiness, increase in risk premium and consequently (in conjunction with an increase of global interest rates in late 70s as well as oil price shocks) in the cost of borrowing and deep economic crisis.","To tackle the first debt service issues, Poland first turned to the USSR in 1975 to get financial support (loan). Trying to bring the balance in the economy, the government introduced several regulatory steps to halt the growing domestic demand (e.g. by raising the prices or introducing the ration stamps) and excessive investments. However those measures proved to be inefficient and the government had to renegotiate the loan's payment terms.

Lack of economic incentives in the centrally planned economy in Poland prior to 1989, which resulted in not economically-backed decisions and the mismanagement in the banking sector, as well as a rapid growth of the sector in the 90's significantly weakened the resilience of the system, which was not capable of facing the economic turmoil in the real economy in the early 90's. At the onset of the economic transition (1989-1990), most loans were to state-owned companies. Their economic standing deteriorated, inter alia as a result of weaker economic ties with the COMECON countries, for which the operations of these state companies were tailored. Furthermore, Poland saw an episode of high/hyper-inflation at the beginning of the economic transition, which in combination with high interest rates pushed some borrowers into debt spirals. The banking sector in Poland experienced then problems, typical for countries with a young financial system (e.g. too loose credit policy and rapid uncontrolled growth, lack of or insufficient control mechanisms and corporate governance, low level of capital, inexperienced staff and management and weak prudential regulations).","The NBP and government interventions were mainly focused on restructuring the banks in order to restore the trust to the banking sector. In 1993, the government decided to partially guarantee ""bad loans"" created until 1992, which arose in banks' balance sheets and commenced issuing restructuring bonds which were transferred to the banks in order to recapitalise them. Together with other transfers, the support for the banking system amounted to 2.7% of 1996 GDP. In 1995 the Bank Guarantee Fund was established (in the meantime, since 1994, the NBP had guaranteed the deposits), however, the scale of such guarantees was limited (up to 3000 ECU). To provide liquidity in the market, the NBP had suspended the obligation to hold reserves at the central bank for some banks and facilitated access to refinancing loans. Additionally, in order to improve the resilience of the system, the rules concerning the banking license were tightened and the banks (especially the cooperative ones) were encouraged to consolidate.

The subsequent Portuguese sovereign debt crisis aggravated the situation, placing further strains on bank’s liquidity situation not only in terms of funding costs but also in their capacity to access international debt markets. Against this backdrop, it is reasonable to assume that the crisis was not triggered by domestic developments, even though domestic imbalances, like private non-financial sector indebtedness, and the sovereign debt crisis have magnified the impact of the crisis.",The crisis was primarily driven by the international financial crisis that restricted Portuguese banks' access to wholesale debt markets. Signs of distress in the banking system following the nationalization of Banco Português de Negócios and the market solution applied to Banco Privado Português in November 2008 were significantly aggravated in consequence of the Portuguese sovereign debt crisis.,"Measures related to the Portuguese financial system implemented by Banco de Portugal: (1) At the end 2008 the Portuguese government announced a set of measures to preserve the stability of the financial system. This set of measures included strengthening of state guarantees for bank deposits, voluntary recapitalization plans for credit institutions headquartered in Portugal and state guarantees to the issue of securitized debt by Portuguese banks. Banco de Portugal recommended in November 2008 a minimum Tier 1 ratio of not less than 8%. (2) In April 2011, financial groups subject to Banco de Portugal supervision on a consolidated basis, and credit institutions on an individual basis, were asked to increase their Core Tier 1 ratios to not less than 8% until December 2011. (3) The Economic and Financial Assistance Programme (EFAP) agreed in May 2011 was based on three pillars: fiscal consolidation, stability of the financial system and structural adjustment of the Portuguese economy. To ensure the stability of the financial system, it was defined that the eight major Portuguese banking groups had to produce medium term funding and capital plans based on a collection of principles and restrictions. Restrictions for these banking groups included compliance with minimum amount of regulatory capital at all times and to reach a credit to deposits ratio of 120 per cent no later than the end of 2014. EFAP also envisaged the intensification of the monitoring of the banking system and its regulation and supervision, for instance a program of special on-site inspections was designed to validate the data on assets that banks provide as inputs to the solvency assessment. Furthermore, it comprehended changes in deposit guarantees funds and resolution mechanisms. (4) In May 2011, a new regulation was approved requiring that financial groups subject to Banco de Portugal supervision on a consolidated basis and also credit institutions on an individual basis meet a minimum Core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9% after the end of 2011 and 10% from the end of 2012 onwards. The regulation envisaged the possibility of Banco de Portugal being more demanding, on a case by case basis, depending on the specific risk profile of each institution / banking group and taking into consideration the results of the solvency and deleveraging assessment framework conducted under the Financial Assistance Programme. (5) In October 2011, Banco de Portugal approved a deduction to Core Tier 1 own funds, based on the amount of deposits contracted with interest rates more than 300 points higher than the relevant Euribor rate for the operation’s reference period.

The Romanian economy was under a centralized economy regime. The increase in the interest rate by the Federal Reserve caused a surge in the cost of the external debt. In 1981, in order to pay its debt, Romania requested the IMF a line of credit but resulted in adopting a program to payback the external loan without international support. The rapid increase of the FED interest rate that started in the late 1970s put pressure on the Romanian debt burden. By the end of 1981, Romanian banks started to accumulate arrears to foreign banks, so the IMF refused to waive the terms of the stand-by loan until an agreement with the foreign banks was reached. This agreement was signed in December 1982. In 1987, Ceaușescu entered an open conflict with the IMF after he stopped the communication of basic economic data to the IMF and a year later he banned contracting new loans from the IMF announcing that Romania gave up on Western financing forever.

Therefore, banks could not recover credits and collect interest, entailing the steady deterioration of profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. Rapid increase in the nonperforming loan ratio (to over 20% in 1997 - 1998 from around 10% in 1996) and the bankruptcy of the largest domestic bank (Bancorex that held more than 20% of the total assets) in 1999. The poor financial situation of some banks stemmed from pressures engendered by the build-up of a number of factors such as: the preferential loans granted to some sectors in virtue of administrative decisions, credit mismanagement, off balance-sheet commitments, etc. Ever since the beginning of 1999, the National Bank of Romania has been implementing a package of bank purging measures aimed at the recovery of the banking system as a whole. In 1996, Dacia Felix Bank and Credit Bank stopped payments. Commencing in 1997, other banks, namely Columna, Bankcoop, and Bancorex, have also been facing financial difficulties that persisted into 1998. IMF has approved in April 1997 a 13-month stand-by credit for Romania, equivalent to SDR 301.5 million (about US$414 million), to support the government’s 1997-98 economic program. Additionally, In the first quarter of 1997, the start of the liberalization of the exchange rate (initiating a managed float type of policy) and the start of the liberalization process for the goods with administered prices contributed to a significant currency depreciation and a major increase in inflation expectations.","The reform of the banking system including bankruptcy legislation and the National Bank of Romania Act In 1996, pursuant to Law No. 64/1995, the National Bank of Romania in its capacity as a creditor took legal action against Dacia Felix Bank and Credit Bank, with a view to restructuring or going into receivership of the two banks.

Motivation: - Excessive credit growth and leverage (most relevant): endogenous risk taking of the banking sector supported with high leverage and high LTD ratios during a boom period prior to the crisis along with decreasing lending standards turned into a severe credit crunch originating in tightening of credit standards and the reduction of credit availability especially to over-indebted non-financial sector. - Mismatches and market illiquidity: Slovenian banking system was highly dependent on short-term funding that demonstrated a sudden drop after the outbreak of the last crisis. - Exposure concentration: Slovenian economy is dependent on very specific sectors and tightly interlinked in terms of the ownership - these characteristics increased the concentration risk. - Misaligned incentives: remuneration models created incentives for the management to grant excessive amounts of credit without proper risk analysis.","The crisis originated in the real sector that was hurt with the outbreak of the worldwide financial (and real sector) crisis after the Lehman Brothers collapse. The freeze of the wholesale financial markets did not allow the banks to prolong short-term loans which deepened the crisis. Both of these contributed to accumulation of bad assets in bank books and consequently put pressure on bank capital trough loan loss provisions and increased capital requirements. In financial distress, when raising capital is extremely difficult, it led to a process of deleveraging in order to fulfil the required capital adequacy ratio. In addition, banks also became more risk averse and increased lending rates which additionally limited the economy to raise funds in banks. This is especially problematic in such country as Slovenia where banks' loans are the prevailing external finance source for the economy. This negative feedback loop contributed to deepening of the banking crisis in the following years.","Measures to stabilise the banking system have had a relatively strong impact on the major balance sheet categories. The following measures were taken: - the recapitalisation of NLB d.d., NKBM d.d., Abanka Vipa d.d., Banka Celje d.d. and two smaller banks, Factor banka d.d. and Probanka d.d., which have been undergoing an orderly wind-down process since September 2013 by the Republic of Slovenia, - the write-down of subordinated instruments (bail-in), - the transfer of certain non-performing claims from recapitalised banks to the Bank Assets Management Company (BAMC); the BAMC has acquired assets paid with the bonds guaranteed by the Republic of Slovenia.   The last transfers of NPLs and last recapitalisation measures took place in December 2014. Regarding the choice of the ""back to normal""date, the NPL criteria for ""back to normal"" date gives Dec. 2013, which is only one month after Slovenian banks reached the NPE peak in Nov. 2013. In Dec.2013 a large portion of NPE was transferred to a bad bank.

Motivation: This choice is not motivated because of the current classical view of this intermediate objective, it means by banks that are to-big-to fail, but because this objective is the closest to the underlying problems causing the crisis and the restructuralisation. These problems include the accumulation of bad loans due to political pressure, due to structural features of the economy and legal system after 1989 and due to the low powers of banks and supervision.","The first clear sign of the structural problems of the banking sector was the liquidity problem of one of the banks in December 1997. After this, and mainly after the elections in 1998, when a new government was elected, banks started to realise losses from non-performing loans on their balance sheet. NPL ratio increased before the restructuralization up to 50 % in case of corporate loans. After this, in December 1999 and June 2000 these loans granted to insolvent corporates were moved from the banks and replaced by government bonds. After the restructuralisation banks were prepared for the privatisation and were sold to foreign banking groups in the period of July 2000 - April 2002.","The first intervention of the National Central Bank was the liquidity support provided for one bank in December 1997. After this, 3 of the biggest banks were recapitalised by the state and the National Bank of Slovakia, bad loans were moved from these banks (loans granted to insolvent companies) and replaced by government bonds. The restructuralisation - it means the increase of own funds and the removal of bad loans was executed in two steps - in December 1999 and June 2000.

The mid-may depreciation of the sterling in 1973 forced the BOE to raise the lending rate in an attempt to support the pound. As a secondary effect it hampered the ability of institutions to access wholesale funding market due to the supplementary special deposit scheme at the time which generated significant liquidity constraints. Hence, the currency problems indirectly triggered the crisis even though the real problem was banking. The crisis materialised with liquidity constraints in money markets. As specific financial institutions lacked liquidity for their operations, sophisticated depositors reviewed their exposure and affected further the liquidity of institutions.","Range of support measures affecting a number of individual institutions.

Even though some small institutions failed from June 1990 there was no reaction or concern from authorities until counterparties were unable to access their funds at the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International). The event generated panic and moved their money to larger institutions. The European Rate Mechanism (ERM) forced the Bank to keep a higher interest rate than the ones required at the time. This exacerbated the economic slowdown, accelerating the fall of property prices. The event is relevant from a macroprudential perspective due to the potential contagion to wholesale market funding. The size of failed institutions was negligible. Nevertheless, the uncertainty and fear in financial institutions could have constrained wholesale market liquidity for SIB's. As in the previous case the structural problem was banking and not currency, but it certainly intensified the problem. For that reason the BoE gave an ELA facility to institutions and built loss provisions in its balance sheet.",Emergency liquidity support provided to UK banks.,0,0,None.,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,n.a.

"Notes: For the systemic crises which occurred after 2007 and notably European sovereign and banking crises in euro area countries, the “back to normal” date has been defined differently because monetary policy continues to be accommodative, while the recovery has been uneven across countries. In this case, the “back to normal” date, which does not exclude further post-crisis adjustment and does not imply a necessary activation of the CCyB, is defined using the following criterion: when 20% of the NPL ratio increase following the start of the crisis was reabsorbed, or alternatively when the output gap is closed (some country exceptions are possible and explained in the database). The NPL ratio considered is the ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans from the International Monetary Fund’s Financial Soundness Indicators database (except for LV where data was provided by national authorities); and the output gap (AMECO database) is considered closed when it has been strictly positive for two consecutive quarters, applying a rounding to the nearest hundredth. For AT, CY, ES, GR, HU, HR, IE, IT, LT, LV, and PT, the ""back to normal"" date is determined by the date when 20% of the increase in the ratio of NPLs to total gross loans after the crisis have been reabsorbed. For FR, NL, UK and SE, due to NPL data availability issues or very low levels of NPLs, the ""back to normal"" date is the date when the output gap becomes positive for two consecutive quarters. For several remaining countries, the ""back to normal"" date was based on ""back to normal"" dates mentioned in the first version of the database (DK, NO, RO), or dates chosen by the national authorities (BE, DE, LU, SI). *The UK was excluded from the dataset in the latest update including crises from 2019 onwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
