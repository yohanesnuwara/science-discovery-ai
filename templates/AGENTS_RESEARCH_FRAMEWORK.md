# Agentic Science Research Framework

All research tasks must follow this six-stage process.

Optimization & Evolution mechanisms apply throughout all stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Observe & Generate Hypothesis

-   Ingest knowledge & data
-   Structure knowledge
-   Formulate hypothesis → identify novel, testable idea

**Optimization & Evolution** - Integrate priors and external knowledge
into planning - Debate, critique, and defend position - Competition to
uncover & patch vulnerability - Repeating own error to improve output -
Validate externally to refine ground (?) - Refine through trial-error &
simulation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Plan the Experiment

-   Generate experimental plan & optimize
    -   Decompose goal into structured & resource-efficient workflow
    -   Plan a list of experiments to run (given an idea and a template)
-   Dynamically select tool

**Optimization & Evolution** - Integrate priors and external knowledge
into planning - Generate reward (self rewarding) - Debate, critique, and
defend position - Competition to uncover & patch vulnerability -
Repeating own error to improve output - Refine through trial-error &
simulation - Validate externally to refine ground (?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Analyze Data

-   Extract multimodal data (parse from chart, etc.)
-   Interpret table & structured data (results)

**Optimization & Evolution** - Debate, critique, and defend position -
Competition to uncover & patch vulnerability - Repeating own error to
improve output - Refine through trial-error & simulation - Validate
externally to refine ground (?) - Generate reward (self rewarding)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Conduct Experiment

-   Execute experiments in order

**Robustness** - Return any errors upon failure or time-out - Fix the
code - Re-attempt up to four times

**Iteration** - After completion of each experiment: - Receive results -
Take notes in the style of an experimental journal - Conditional on the
results: - Re-plan and implement the next experiment - Repeat process up
to five times - Full history of execution must remain visible

**Optimization & Evolution** - Repeating own error to improve output -
Refine through trial-error & simulation - Generate reward (self
rewarding) - Debate, critique, and defend position - Competition to
uncover & patch vulnerability - Validate externally to refine ground (?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Analyze Results

-   Interpret table & structured data (results)
    -   Interleave reasoning to connect result to hypothesis
-   Validate hypothesis & filter
-   Generate insight
-   May implement entirely new plots
-   May collect new metrics not in the seed templates

**Optimization & Evolution** - Debate, critique, and defend position -
Competition to uncover & patch vulnerability - Repeating own error to
improve output - Refine through trial-error & simulation - Validate
externally to refine ground (?) - Generate reward (self rewarding)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Synthesize, Validate & Evolve

-   Synthesize evidence & critique

-   Self correction & evolution

    -   Verify finding through automated replication check
    -   Expand toolkit
    -   Update internal knowledge

-   Adaptive refinement & recycle

    -   Learn from past experiment to improve future strategy

**Visualization** - Edit plotting script using Python - Create figures
for the paper - Write a note describing what each plot contains - Saved
figures and experimental notes provide required information for the
paper

**Optimization & Evolution** - Repeating own error to improve output -
Refine through trial-error & simulation - Generate reward (self
rewarding) - Integrate priors and external knowledge into planning -
Debate, critique, and defend position - Competition to uncover & patch
vulnerability - Validate externally to refine ground (?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Experimental journal notes must be saved inside `.output/` alongside
plots.**
